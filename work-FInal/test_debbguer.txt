I recently encountered this issue with system-installed `ffmpeg`, and pip-installed `ffmpeg-python` within a conda environment.

The work-around for me was uninstalling the system ffmpeg and installing as [ffmpeg as a conda package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ffmpeg) within my conda environment:


```
# Uninstall ffmpeg system install (assumes Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get remove ffmpeg -y
sudo apt-get purge ffmpeg -y

# Install ffmpeg in conda env
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```
